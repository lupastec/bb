* *memory utilization* 


## 2. SUCH POOR HEALTH! 

### You want to monitor the health of your network using Cisco Catalyst Center. How many ACCESS switches are shown as being in a healthy state?

* *37*

## 3. CLOSE TO PERFECT? 

### You are getting reports that some users are experiencing long onboarding time when connecting to the wireless network. You are concerned about these reports and want to know the overall health of the wireless network. Using Cisco Catalyst Center Assurance, what percentage of clients are onboarded under 10 seconds?

* *96*


## 4. BEING GRACEFUL 

### Grace Smith has called in to report that she had troubles connecting her iPad to the network earlier in the day. It is working ok now, but she would like more details on what happened earlier. Use the Client 360 view to examine the Issues at the time when the health score is low.There is an Issue indicating that an application is experiencing High Latency. What application is identified in that alert?

* *MedicalRecords*


## 5. MACHINE INTELLECT: AI-DRIVEN ISSSUES 

### In this Capture the Flag challenge, your task involves navigating the Catalyst Center WebUI to explore Issues and Events. You will then use Machine Reasoning to first Identify an issue exists and how to resolve the issue. Read the task details for more information. To find this flag, find the configuration-level command that Catalyst Center suggests as a next step to resolve this issue.

* *no shutdown*


## 6. 360 SEARCH: CATALYST CENTER AI CLIENT VIEW 

### In this Capture the Flag challenge, your task is to analyze the User 360 view for Grace Smith's iPad in the Catalyst Center Assurance dashboard. You'll observe the device details used by the client, roaming and connectivity history for the user and determine causes for client disconnections. What is the first reason given for client disconnections under iOS Analytics?

* *User triggered disassociation*


## 7. AI NETWORK ANALYTICS TRENDS AND INSIGHTS

### In this Capture the Flag mission you will navigate the Catalyst Center Trends and Insights of AI-Network Analytics. Become a seasoned wireless engineer and analyze RF data relative to referenced radios operation under optimal conditions through the eyes of Catalyst Center AI Endpoint Analytics. You will also assess the impacted clients to understand the scope of a poor performing access point. To Capture this flag, what is the number of clients that are impacted by the high co-channel interference on access point SFO15-C9136-01?

* *17*

## 8. PEERSPECTIVE: CATALYST CENTER PEER COMPARISON ANALYSIS 

### In this Capture the Flag challenge, your mission is to navigate the Catalyst Center Peer Comparison Analysis. You will be required to delve into the data and metrics, comparing your own network's performance with that of your peers in the same industry or sector. Your objective is not only to capture the flag but also to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Catalyst Center AI enables you to understand where your networks stands in relation to your peers and how you can leverage this understanding for the benefit of your operations. The expected flag for this task is the percentage of time that peer networks maintain an RSSI of -50dBm or higher on the 5Ghz band?

* *32.44* 

## 9. AI NETWORK ANALYTICS: BASELINE AND NETWORK COMPARISON

### In this Capture the Flag challenge, you become familiar with Catalyst Center's Network Comparisons and Baseline Features. Your mission is to navigate these key components of network analysis and management. Your tasks will involve conducting a thorough comparison of your network's performance, trends, and metrics with those of other networks using the Network Comparison feature. You'll need to identify strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement in your network. Simultaneously, you'll be utilizing the Baseline Feature to establish a standard of performance for your network. This baseline will serve as your reference point for tracking changes, identifying anomalies, and measuring performance over time. This challenge will test your analytical and strategic thinking skills but also your ability to use these features to improve network performance. Your ultimate goal is to capture the flag while gaining valuable insights that can aid in the optimization of your network. To capture this flag, examine AI Baseline data for Onboarding Failures reported between 5:00pm â€“ 5:30 pm in SFO15.How many clients are reported as being impacted?

* *8*


## 10. CATALYST CENTER'S AI-ENHANCED RRM 

### What is the primary benefit of integrating ASSA ABLOY door locks with Meraki wireless infrastructure? In this Capture the Flag challenge, you'll be exploring the power and potential of Catalyst Center's AI-Enhanced RRM (Radio Resource Management). Your mission involves mastering the use of artificial intelligence to optimize the performance of wireless networks. You'll be required to dynamically manage and allocate radio frequency resources, adjust parameters, and configure settings - all in real-time and with minimal manual intervention. Your tasks will include monitoring the network environment, identifying and reducing interference, and maintaining network stability. You'll have to utilize the AI RRM feature to make automated decisions about channel assignments, power levels, and other radio settings, while considering the changing needs and conditions of the network. This challenge will test your understanding of AI in network management, your problem-solving skills, and your ability to improve network performance using advanced technology. Your ultimate goal is to capture the flag while enhancing network efficiency, performance, and reliability with the power of AI. Use the Task Details for guidance on how to find this flag. Examine the AI RRM recommendations for building SJC01. After accepting the recommended channel width changes, what percentage of APs are experiencing high channel interference on the 2.4Ghz Band?
